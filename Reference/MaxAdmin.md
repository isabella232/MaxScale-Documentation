# Overview

MaxAdmin is a simple client interface that can be used to interact with the MariaDB MaxScale server, it allows the display of internal MariaDB MaxScale statistics, status and control of MariaDB MaxScale operations.

MaxAdmin supports

* Interactive user sessions

* Execution of one-off commands via command line arguments

* Execution of command scripts

<a name="running"></a>
# Running MaxAdmin

The MaxAdmin client application may be run in two different modes, either as an interactive command shell for executing commands against MariaDB MaxScale or by passing commands on the MaxAdmin command line itself.

<a name="interface"></a>
# Working With Administration Interface Users

MaxScale communicates with MariaDB MaxScale using UNIX domain sockets, which means that it can only be used on the very host where MariaDB MaxScale is running. Initially MaxAdmin can connect only when run as `root`. Other Linux users can subsequently be allowed access.

**NOTE**: Remote access with -h and -P options is no longer supported.

## What Users Have Been Defined?

In order to see the current users (UNIX users) that have been defined for the administration interface use the command _show users_.

    MaxScale> show users
    Administration interface users:
    User names: vilho, dba, massi, mark
    MaxScale>

Please note `root` will not be shown.

    MaxScale> show users
    Administration interface users:
    No administration users have been defined.
    MaxScale>

## Add A New User

To add a new administrative user to the MariaDB MaxScale server use the command _add user_. This command is passed a user name, which should be the same as that of an existing Linux user.

    MaxScale> add user maria
    User maria has been successfully added.
    MaxScale>

Note that a user that is given the rights to use MaxAdmin, has the very same rights `root` has, including adding and removing users.

## Delete A User

To remove a user the command _remove user_ is used and it is simply invoked with the user to be removed.

    MaxScale> remove user maria
    User maria has been successfully removed.
    MaxScale>

Note that it is possible to remove the current user, but that will only affect the next attempt to use MaxAdmin. `root` cannot be removed.

# Command Line Switches

The MaxAdmin command accepts a number of switches

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Switch</td>
    <td>Long Option</td>
    <td>Description</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>-S socket path</td>
    <td>--socket=...</td>
    <td>The UNIX domain socket path that MaxAdmin will use to connect to the MariaDB MaxScale server. If no -S option is given then the default socket path /tmp/maxadmin.sock will be used.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>-?</td>
    <td>--help</td>
    <td>Print usage information regarding MaxAdmin</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>-v</td>
    <td>--version</td>
    <td>Print the maxadmin version information and exit</td>
  </tr>
</table>


When a switch takes a value, this may either be as the next argument on the command line or maybe as part of the switch itself, e.g. -S path and -Spath are treated in the same way.

## Interactive Operation

If no arguments other than the command line switches are passed to MaxAdmin it will enter its interactive mode of operation. Users will be prompted to enter commands with a **MaxScale>** prompt. The commands themselves are documented in the sections later in this document. A help system is available that will give some minimal details of the commands available.

Command history is available on platforms that support the libedit library. This allows the use of the up and down arrow keys to recall previous commands that have been executed by MaxAdmin. The default edit mode for the history is to emulate the vi commands, the behavior of libedit may however be customized using the .editrc file. To obtain the history of commands that have been executed use the inbuilt history command.

In interactive mode it is possible to execute a set of commands stored in an external file by using the source command. The command takes the argument of a filename which should contain a set of MariaDB MaxScale commands, one per line. These will be executed in the order they appear in the file.

## Command Line Operation

MaxAdmin can also be used to execute commands that are passed on the command line, e.g.

    -bash-4.1$ maxadmin -S /tmp/maxadmin.sock list services
    Password:
    Services.
    --------------------------+----------------------+--------+---------------
    Service Name              | Router Module        | #Users | Total Sessions
    --------------------------+----------------------+--------+---------------
    Test Service              | readconnroute        |      1 |     1
    Split Service             | readwritesplit       |      1 |     1
    Filter Service            | readconnroute        |      1 |     1
    QLA Service               | readconnroute        |      1 |     1
    Debug Service             | debugcli             |      1 |     1
    CLI                       | cli                  |      2 |    27
    --------------------------+----------------------+--------+---------------
    -bash-4.1$

The single command is executed and MaxAdmin then terminates. If the -p option is not given then MaxAdmin will prompt for a password. If a MariaDB MaxScale command requires an argument which contains whitespace, for example a service name, that name should be quoted. The quotes will be preserved and used in the execution of the MariaDB MaxScale command.

    -bash-4.1$ maxadmin show service "QLA Service"
        Password:
        Service 0x70c6a0
                Service:                QLA Service
                Router:                 readconnroute (0x7ffff0f7ae60)
                Number of router sessions:      0
                Current no. of router sessions: 0
                Number of queries forwarded:    0
                Started:                Wed Jun 25 10:08:23 2014
                Backend databases
                        127.0.0.1:3309  Protocol: MySQLBackend
                        127.0.0.1:3308  Protocol: MySQLBackend
                        127.0.0.1:3307  Protocol: MySQLBackend
                        127.0.0.1:3306  Protocol: MySQLBackend
                Users data:             0x724340
                Total connections:      1
                Currently connected:    1
        -bash-4.1$

Command files may be executed by either calling MaxAdmin with the name of the file that contains the commands

    maxadmin listall.ms

Or by using the #! mechanism to make the command file executable from the shell. To do this add a line at the start of your command file that contains the #! directive with the path of the MaxAdmin executable. Command options may also be given in this line. For example to create a script file that runs a set of list commands

    #!/usr/local/bin/maxadmin
    list modules
    list servers
    list services
    list listeners
    list dcbs
    list sessions
    list filters

Then simply set this file to have execute permissions and it may be run like any other command in the Linux shell.

## The .maxadmin file

MaxAdmin supports a mechanism to set defaults for all the command line switches via a file in the home directory of the user. If a file named .maxadmin exists it will be read and parameters set according to the lies in this files. The parameter that can be set is: socket. An example of a .maxadmin file that will alter the default password and user name arguments would be

    socket=/somepath/maxadmin.socket

This mechanism can be used to provide a means of passwords entry into maxadmin or to override any of the command line option defaults. If a command line option is given that will still override the value in the .maxadmin file.

The .maxadmin file may  be made read only to protect any passwords written to that file.

# Getting Help

A help system is available that describes the commands available via the administration interface. To obtain a list of all commands available simply type the command help.

    MaxScale> help
    Available commands:
        add user
        clear server
        disable [heartbeat|log|root]
        enable [heartbeat|log|root]
        list [clients|dcbs|filters|listeners|modules|monitors|services|servers|sessions]

# Working With Services

A service is a very important concept in MariaDB MaxScale as it defines the mechanism by which clients interact with MariaDB MaxScale and can attached to the backend databases. A number of commands exist that allow interaction with the services.

## What Services Are Available?

The _list services_ command can be used to discover what services are currently available within your MariaDB MaxScale configuration.

    MaxScale> list services
    Services.
    --------------------------+----------------------+--------+---------------
    Service Name              | Router Module        | #Users | Total Sessions
    --------------------------+----------------------+--------+---------------
    Test Service              | readconnroute        |      1 |     1
    Split Service             | readwritesplit       |      1 |     1
    Filter Service            | readconnroute        |      1 |     1
    QLA Service               | readconnroute        |      1 |     1
    Debug Service             | debugcli             |      1 |     1
    CLI                       | cli                  |      2 |    24
    --------------------------+----------------------+--------+---------------
    MaxScale>

In order to determine which ports services are using then the _list listeners_ command can be used.

    MaxScale> list listeners
    Listeners.
    ---------------------+--------------------+-----------------+-------+--------
    Service Name         | Protocol Module    | Address         | Port  | State
    ---------------------+--------------------+-----------------+-------+--------
    Test Service         | MySQLClient        | *               |  4006 | Running
    Split Service        | MySQLClient        | *               |  4007 | Running
    Filter Service       | MySQLClient        | *               |  4008 | Running
    QLA Service          | MySQLClient        | *               |  4009 | Running
    Debug Service        | telnetd            | localhost       |  4242 | Running
    CLI                  | maxscaled          | localhost       |  6603 | Running
    ---------------------+--------------------+-----------------+-------+--------
    MaxScale>

## See Service Details

It is possible to see the details of an individual service using the _show service_ command. This command should be passed the name of the service you wish to examine as an argument. Where a service name contains spaces characters there should either be escaped or the name placed in quotes.

    MaxScale> show service "QLA Service"
    Service 0x70c6a0
        Service:                                QLA Service
        Router:                         readconnroute (0x7ffff0f7ae60)
        Number of router sessions:      0
        Current no. of router sessions: 0
        Number of queries forwarded:    0
        Started:                                Wed Jun 25 10:08:23 2014
        Backend databases
                127.0.0.1:3309  Protocol: MySQLBackend
                127.0.0.1:3308  Protocol: MySQLBackend
                127.0.0.1:3307  Protocol: MySQLBackend
                127.0.0.1:3306  Protocol: MySQLBackend
        Users data:                             0x724340
        Total connections:                      1
        Currently connected:                    1
    MaxScale>

This allows the set of backend servers defined by the service to be seen along with the service statistics and other information.

## Examining Service Users

MariaDB MaxScale provides an authentication model by which the client application authenticates with MariaDB MaxScale using the credentials they would normally use to with the database itself. MariaDB MaxScale loads the user data from one of the backend databases defined for the service. The _show dbusers_ command can be used to examine the user data held by MariaDB MaxScale.

    MaxScale> show dbusers "Filter Service"
    User names: pappo@%, rana@%, new_control@%, new_nuovo@%, uno@192.168.56.1, nuovo@192.168.56.1, pesce@%, tryme@192.168.1.199, repluser@%, seven@%, due@%, pippo@%, mmm@%, daka@127.0.0.1, timour@%, ivan@%, prova@%, changeme@127.0.0.1, uno@%, massimiliano@127.0.0.1, massim@127.0.0.1, massi@127.0.0.1, masssi@127.0.0.1, pappo@127.0.0.1, rana@127.0.0.1, newadded@127.0.0.1, newaded@127.0.0.1, pesce@127.0.0.1, repluser@127.0.0.1, seven@127.0.0.1, pippo@127.0.0.1, due@127.0.0.1, nopwd@127.0.0.1, timour@127.0.0.1, controlla@192.168.56.1, ivan@127.0.0.1, ppp@127.0.0.1, daka@%, nuovo@127.0.0.1, uno@127.0.0.1, repluser@192.168.56.1, havoc@%, tekka@192.168.1.19, due@192.168.56.1, qwerty@127.0.0.1, massimiliano@%, massi@%, massim@%
    MaxScale>

## Reloading Service User Data

MariaDB MaxScale will automatically reload user data if there are failed authentication requests from client applications. This reloading is rate limited and triggered by missing entries in the MariaDB MaxScale table. If a user is removed from the backend database user table it will not trigger removal from the MariaDB MaxScale internal table. The reload dbusers command can be used to force the reloading of the user table within MariaDB MaxScale.

    MaxScale> reload dbusers "Split Service"
    Loaded 34 database users for service Split Service.
    MaxScale>

## Stopping A Service

It is possible to stop a service from accepting new connections by using the _shutdown service_ command. This will not affect the connections that are already in place for a service, but will stop any new connections from being accepted.

    MaxScale> shutdown service "Split Service"
    MaxScale>

## Restart A Stopped Service

A stopped service may be restarted by using the _restart service_ command.

    MaxScale> restart service "Split Service"
    MaxScale>

<a name="servers"></a>
# Working With Servers

The server represents each of the instances of MySQL or MariaDB that a service may use.

## What Servers Are Configured?

The command _list servers_ can be used to display a list of all the servers configured within MariaDB MaxScale.

    MaxScale> list servers
    Servers.
    -------------------+-----------------+-------+----------------------+------------
    Server             | Address         | Port  | Status               | Connections
    -------------------+-----------------+-------+----------------------+------------
    server1            | 127.0.0.1       |  3306 | Running              |    0
    server2            | 127.0.0.1       |  3307 | Master, Running      |    0
    server3            | 127.0.0.1       |  3308 | Running              |    0
    server4            | 127.0.0.1       |  3309 | Slave, Running       |    0
    -------------------+-----------------+-------+----------------------+------------
    MaxScale>

## Server Details

It is possible to see more details regarding a given server using the _show server_ command.

    MaxScale> show server server2
    Server 0x70d460 (server2)
        Server:                         127.0.0.1
        Status:                         Master, Running
        Protocol:                       MySQLBackend
        Port:                           3307
        Server Version:                 5.5.25-MariaDB-log
        Node Id:                        124
        Number of connections:          0
        Current no. of conns:           0
        Current no. of operations:      0
    MaxScale>

If the server has a non-zero value set for the server configuration item "persistpoolmax",
then additional information will be shown:

        Persistent pool size:            1
        Persistent measured pool size:   1
        Persistent pool max size:        10
        Persistent max time (secs):      3660

The distinction between pool size and measured pool size is that the first is a
counter that is updated when operations affect the persistent connections pool,
whereas the measured size is the result of checking how many persistent connections
are currently in the pool. It can be slightly different, since any expired
connections are removed during the check.

## Setting The State Of A Server

MariaDB MaxScale maintains a number of status bits for each server that is configured, these status bits are normally maintained by the monitors, there are two commands in the user interface that are used to manually maintain these bits also; the _set server_ and _clear server_ commands.

The status bit that can be controlled are

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Bit Name</td>
    <td>Description</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>running</td>
    <td>The server is responding to requests, accepting connections and executing database commands</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>master</td>
    <td>The server is a master in a replication setup or should be considered as a destination for database updates.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>slave</td>
    <td>The server is a replication slave or is considered as a read only database.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>synced</td>
    <td>The server is a fully fledged member of a Galera cluster</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>maintenance</td>
    <td>The server is in maintenance mode. In this mode no new connections will be established to the server. The monitors will also not monitor servers that are in maintenance mode.</td>
  </tr>
</table>


All status bits, with the exception of the maintenance bit, will be set by the monitors that are monitoring the server. If manual control is required the monitor should be stopped.

    MaxScale> set server server3 maintenance
    MaxScale> clear server server3 maintenance
    MaxScale>

## Viewing the persistent pool of DCB

The DCBs that are in the pool for a particular server can be displayed (in the
format described below in the DCB section) with a command like:

    MaxScale> show persistent server1

<a name="sessions"></a>
# Working With Sessions

The MariaDB MaxScale session represents the state within MariaDB MaxScale. Sessions are dynamic entities and not named in the configuration file, this means that sessions can not be easily named within the user interface. The sessions are referenced using ID values, these are actually memory address, however the important thing is that no two session have the same ID.

## What Sessions Are Active in MariaDB MaxScale?

There are a number of ways to find out what sessions are active, the most comprehensive being the _list sessions_ command.

    MaxScale> list sessions
    Sessions.
    -----------------+-----------------+----------------+--------------------------
    Session          | Client          | Service        | State
    -----------------+-----------------+----------------+--------------------------
    0x7267a0         | 127.0.0.1       | CLI            | Session ready for routing
    0x726340         |                 | CLI            | Listener Session
    0x725720         |                 | Debug Service  | Listener Session
    0x724720         |                 | QLA Service    | Listener Session
    0x72a750         |                 | Filter Service | Listener Session
    0x709500         |                 | Split Service  | Listener Session
    0x7092d0         |                 | Test Service   | Listener Session
    -----------------+-----------------+----------------+--------------------------
    MaxScale>

This lists all the sessions for both user connections and for the service listeners.

The _list clients_ command will give just the subset of sessions that originate from a client connection.

    MaxScale> list clients
    Client Connections
    -----------------+------------+----------------------+------------
     Client          | DCB        | Service              | Session
    -----------------+------------+----------------------+------------
     127.0.0.1       |   0x7274b0 | CLI                  |   0x727700
     127.0.0.1       |   0x727900 | QLA Service          |   0x727da0
    -----------------+------------+----------------------+------------
    MaxScale>

## Display Session Details

Once the session ID has been determined using one of the above method it is possible to determine more detail regarding a session by using the _show session_ command.

    MaxScale> show session 0x727da0
    Session 0x727da0

# Descriptor Control Blocks

The Descriptor Control Block or DCB is a very important entity within MariaDB MaxScale, it represents the state of each connection within MariaDB MaxScale. A DCB is allocated for every connection from a client, every network listener and every connection to a backend database. Statistics for each of these connections are maintained within these DCB’s.

As with session above the DCB’s are not named and are therefore referred to by the use of a unique ID, the memory address of the DCB.

## Finding DCB’s

There are several ways to determine what DCB’s are active within a MariaDB MaxScale server, the most straightforward being the _list dcbs_ command.

    MaxScale> list dcbs
    Descriptor Control Blocks
    ------------+----------------------------+----------------------+----------
     DCB        | State                      | Service              | Remote
    ------------+----------------------------+----------------------+----------
       0x667170 | DCB for listening socket   | Test Service         |
       0x71a350 | DCB for listening socket   | Split Service        |
       0x724b40 | DCB for listening socket   | Filter Service       |
       0x7250d0 | DCB for listening socket   | QLA Service          |
       0x725740 | DCB for listening socket   | Debug Service        |
       0x726740 | DCB for listening socket   | CLI                  |
       0x7274b0 | DCB in the polling loop    | CLI                  | 127.0.0.1
       0x727900 | DCB in the polling loop    | QLA Service          | 127.0.0.1
       0x72e880 | DCB in the polling loop    | QLA Service          |
    ------------+----------------------------+----------------------+----------
    MaxScale>

A MariaDB MaxScale server that has activity on it will however have many more DCB’s than in the example above, making it hard to find the DCB that you require. The DCB ID is also included in a number of other command outputs, depending on the information you have it may be easier to use other methods to locate a particular DCB.

## DCB Of A Client Connection

To find the DCB for a particular client connection it may be best to start with the list clients command and then look at each DCB for a particular client address to determine the one of interest.

## DCB Details

The details of an individual DCB can be obtained by use of the _show dcb_ command

    MaxScale> show dcb 0x727900
    DCB: 0x727900
        DCB state:              DCB in the polling loop
        Username:               somename
        Protocol:               MySQLBackend
        Server Status:          Master, running
        Role:                   Request Handler
        Connected to:           127.0.0.1
        Owning Session:         0x727da0
        Statistics:
                No. of Reads:                   4
                No. of Writes:                  3
                No. of Buffered Writes:         0
                No. of Accepts:                 0
                No. of High Water Events:       0
                No. of Low Water Events:        0
                Added to persistent pool:       Jun 24 09:09:56
    MaxScale>

The information Username, Protocol, Server Status are not
always relevant, and will not be shown when they are null.
The time the DCB was added to the persistent pool is only shown
for a DCB that is in a persistent pool.

# Working with Filters

Filters allow the request contents and result sets from a database to be modified for a client connection, pipelines of filters can be created between the client connection and MariaDB MaxScale router modules.

## What Filters Are Configured?

Filters are configured in the configuration file for MariaDB MaxScale, they are given names and may be included in the definition of a service. The _list filters_ command can be used to determine which filters are defined.

    MaxScale> list filters
    Filters
    --------------------+-----------------+----------------------------------------
    Filter              | Module          | Options
    --------------------+-----------------+----------------------------------------
    counter             | testfilter      |
    QLA                 | qlafilter       | /tmp/QueryLog
    Replicate           | tee             |
    QLA_BLR             | qlafilter       | /tmp/QueryLog.blr0
    regex               | regexfilter     |
    MySQL5.1            | regexfilter     |
    top10               | topfilter       |
    --------------------+-----------------+----------------------------------------
    MaxScale>

## Retrieve Details Of A Filter Configuration

The command _show filter_ can be used to display information related to a particular filter.

    MaxScale> show filter QLA
    Filter 0x719460 (QLA)
        Module: qlafilter
        Options:        /tmp/QueryLog
                Limit logging to connections from       127.0.0.1
                Include queries that match              select.*from.*user.*where
    MaxScale>

## Filter Usage

The _show session_ command will include details for each of the filters in use within a session.  First use _list sessions_ or _list clients_ to find the session of interest and then run the _show session_ command

    MaxScale> list clients

# Working With Monitors

Monitors are used to monitor the state of databases within MariaDB MaxScale in order to supply information to other modules, specifically the routers within MariaDB MaxScale.

## What Monitors Are Running?

To see what monitors are running within MariaDB MaxScale use the _list monitors_ command.

    MaxScale> list monitors
    +----------------------+---------------------
    | Monitor              | Status
    +----------------------+---------------------
    | MySQL Monitor        | Running
    +----------------------+---------------------
    MaxScale>

## Details Of A Particular Monitor

To see the details of a particular monitor use the _show monitor_ command.

    MaxScale> show monitor "MySQL Monitor"
    Monitor: 0x71c370
        Name:           MySQL Monitor
        Monitor running
        Sampling interval:      10000 milliseconds

        Replication lag:        disabled
        Monitored servers:      127.0.0.1:3306, 127.0.0.1:3307, 127.0.0.1:3308, 127.0.0.1:3309
    MaxScale>

## Controlling Replication Heartbeat

Some monitors provide a replication heartbeat mechanism that monitors the delay for data that is replicated from a master to slaves in a tree structured replication environment. This can be enabled or disabled using the commands _enable heartbeat_ and _disable heartbeat_.

    MaxScale> disable heartbeat "MySQL Monitor"
    MaxScale> enable heartbeat "MySQL Monitor"
    MaxScale>

Please note that changes made via this interface will not persist across restarts of MariaDB MaxScale. To make a permanent change edit the maxscale.cnf file.

Enabling the replication heartbeat mechanism will add the display of heartbeat information in the show server output

    MaxScale> show server server4

## Shutting Down A Monitor

A monitor may be shutdown using the _shutdown monitor_ command. This allows for manual control of the status of servers using the _set server_ and _clear server_ commands.

    MaxScale> shutdown monitor "MySQL Monitor"
    MaxScale> list monitors
    +----------------------+---------------------
    | Monitor              | Status

# MaxScale Status Commands

A number of commands exists that enable the internal MariaDB MaxScale status to be revealed, these commands give an insight to how MariaDB MaxScale is using resource internally and are used to allow the tuning process to take place.

## MariaDB MaxScale Thread Usage

MariaDB MaxScale uses a number of threads, as defined in the MariaDB MaxScale configuration file, to execute the processing of requests received from clients and the handling of responses. The _show threads_ command can be used to determine what each thread is currently being used for.

    MaxScale> show threads
    Polling Threads.
    Historic Thread Load Average: 1.00.
    Current Thread Load Average: 1.00.
    15 Minute Average: 0.48, 5 Minute Average: 1.00, 1 Minute Average: 1.00
    Pending event queue length averages:
    15 Minute Average: 0.90, 5 Minute Average: 1.83, 1 Minute Average: 2.00
     ID | State      | # fds  | Descriptor       | Running  | Event
    ----+------------+--------+------------------+----------+---------------
      0 | Processing |      1 | 0xf55a70         | <  100ms | IN|OUT
      1 | Processing |      1 | 0xf49ba0         | <  100ms | IN|OUT
      2 | Processing |      1 | 0x7f54c0030d00   | <  100ms | IN|OUT
    MaxScale>

The resultant output returns data as to the average thread utilization for the past minutes 5 minutes and 15 minutes. It also gives a table, with a row per thread that shows what DCB that thread is currently processing events for, the events it is processing and how long, to the nearest 100ms has been send processing these events.

## The Event Queue

At the core of MariaDB MaxScale is an event driven engine that is processing network events for the network connections between MariaDB MaxScale and client applications and MariaDB MaxScale and the backend servers. It is possible to see the event queue using the _show eventq_ command. This will show the events currently being executed and those that are queued for execution.

    MaxScale> show eventq
    Event Queue.
    DCB              | Status     | Processing Events  | Pending Events
    -----------------+------------+--------------------+-------------------
    0x1e22f10        | Processing | IN|OUT             |
    MaxScale>

The output of this command gives the DCB’s that are currently in the event queue, the events queued for that DCB, and events that are being processed for that DCB.

## The Housekeeper Tasks

Internally MariaDB MaxScale has a housekeeper thread that is used to  perform periodic tasks, it is possible to use the command show tasks to see what tasks are outstanding within the housekeeper.

    MaxScale> show tasks
    Name                      | Type     | Frequency | Next Due
    --------------------------+----------+-----------+-------------------------
    Load Average              | Repeated | 10        | Wed Nov 19 15:10:51 2014

# Administration Commands

## What Modules Are In use?

In order to determine what modules are in use, and the version and status of those modules the _list modules_ command can be used.

    MaxScale> list modules
    Modules.
    ----------------+-------------+---------+-------+-------------------------
    Module Name     | Module Type | Version | API   | Status
    ----------------+-------------+---------+-------+-------------------------
    tee             | Filter      | V1.0.0  | 1.1.0 | Alpha
    qlafilter       | Filter      | V1.1.1  | 1.1.0 | Alpha
    topfilter       | Filter      | V1.0.1  | 1.1.0 | Alpha
    MySQLBackend    | Protocol    | V2.0.0  | 1.0.0 | Alpha
    maxscaled       | Protocol    | V1.0.0  | 1.0.0 | Alpha
    telnetd         | Protocol    | V1.0.1  | 1.0.0 | Alpha
    MySQLClient     | Protocol    | V1.0.0  | 1.0.0 | Alpha
    mysqlmon        | Monitor     | V1.2.0  | 1.0.0 | Alpha
    readconnroute   | Router      | V1.0.2  | 1.0.0 | Alpha
    readwritesplit  | Router      | V1.0.2  | 1.0.0 | Alpha
    debugcli        | Router      | V1.1.1  | 1.0.0 | Alpha
    cli             | Router      | V1.0.0  | 1.0.0 | Alpha
    ----------------+-------------+---------+-------+-------------------------
    MaxScale>

This command provides important version information for the module. Each module has two versions; the version of the module itself and the version of the module API that it supports. Also included in the output is the status of the module, this may be "In Development", “Alpha”, “Beta”, “GA” or “Experimental”.

## Enabling syslog and maxlog logging

MariaDB MaxScale can log messages to syslog, to a log file or to both. The approach can be set in the config file, but can also be changed from maxadmin. Syslog logging is identified by *syslog* and file logging by *maxlog*.

    MaxScale> enable syslog
    MaxScale> disable maxlog

**NOTE** If you disable both, then you will see no messages at all.

## Rotating the log file

MariaDB MaxScale logs messages to a log file in the log directory of MariaDB MaxScale. As the log file grows continuously, it is recommended to periodically rotate it. When rotated, the current log file will be closed and a new one with a new name opened. The log file name contain a sequence number, which is incremented each time the log is rotated.

There are two ways for rotating the log - *flush log maxscale* and *flush logs* - and the result is identical. The two alternatives are due to historical reasons; earlier MariaDB MaxScale had several different log files.

    MaxScale> flush log maxscale
    MaxScale>
    The flush logs command may be used to rotate all logs with a single command.
    MaxScale> flush logs
    MaxScale>

## Change MariaDB MaxScale Logging Options

From version 1.3 onwards, MariaDB MaxScale has a single log file where messages of various priority (aka severity) are logged. Consequently, you no longer enable or disable log files but log priorities. The priorities are the same as those of syslog and the ones that can be enabled or disabled are *debug*, *info*, *notice* and *warning*. *Error* and any more severe messages can not be disabled.

Please note that changes made via this interface will not persist across restarts of MariaDB MaxScale. To make a permanent change edit the maxscale.cnf file.

## Reloading The Configuration

A command, _reload config_, is available that will cause MariaDB MaxScale to reload the maxscale.cnf configuration file.

## Shutting Down MariaDB MaxScale

The MariaDB MaxScale server may be shutdown using the _shutdown maxscale_ command.

# Configuring MariaDB MaxScale to Accept MaxAdmin Connections

In order to enable the use of MaxAdmin, the service CLI with an accompanying listener must be added to the MariaDB MaxScale configuration file.

The default entries required are shown below.

    [CLI]
    type=service
    router=cli

    [CLI Listener]
    type=listener
    service=CLI
    protocol=maxscaled
    socket=default
    #socket=/somepath/maxadmin.socket

**NOTE**: As the protocol maxscaled only supports UNIX domain sockets it is thus not possible to connect remotely to MariaDB MaxScale.

In the example, the default socket path (/tmp/maxadmin.sock) is used. It can be changed to an specific path and in that case MaxAdmin must be invoked with the -S option.

# Tuning MariaDB MaxScale

The way that MariaDB MaxScale does it’s polling is that each of the polling threads, as defined by the threads parameter in the configuration file, will call epoll_wait to obtain the events that are to be processed. The events are then added to a queue for execution. Any thread can read from this queue, not just the thread that added the event.

Once the thread has done an epoll call with no timeout it will either do an epoll_wait call with a timeout or it will take an event from the queue if there is one. These two new parameters affect this behavior.

The first parameter, which may be set by using the non_blocking_polls option in the configuration file, controls the number of epoll_wait calls that will be issued without a timeout before MariaDB MaxScale will make a call with a timeout value. The advantage of performing a call without a timeout is that the kernel treats this case as different and will not rescheduled the process in this case. If a timeout is passed then the system call will cause the MariaDB MaxScale thread to be put back in the scheduling queue and may result in lost CPU time to MariaDB MaxScale. Setting the value of this parameter too high will cause MariaDB MaxScale to consume a lot of CPU when there is infrequent work to be done. The default value of this parameter is 3.

This parameter may also be set via the maxadmin client using the command _set nbpolls <number>_.

The second parameter is the maximum sleep value that MariaDB MaxScale will pass to epoll_wait. What normally happens is that MariaDB MaxScale will do an epoll_wait call with a sleep value that is 10% of the maximum, each time the returns and there is no more work to be done MariaDB MaxScale will increase this percentage by 10%. This will continue until the maximum value is reached or until there is some work to be done. Once the thread finds some work to be done it will reset the sleep time it uses to 10% of the maximum.

The maximum sleep time is set in milliseconds and can be placed in the [maxscale] section of the configuration file with the poll_sleep parameter. Alternatively it may be set in the maxadmin client using the command _set pollsleep <number>_. The default value of this parameter is 1000.

Setting this value too high means that if a thread collects a large number of events and adds to the event queue, the other threads might not return from the epoll_wait calls they are running for some time resulting in less overall performance. Setting the sleep time too low will cause MariaDB MaxScale to wake up too often and consume CPU time when there is no work to be done.

The _show epoll_ command can be used to see how often we actually poll with a timeout, the first two values output are significant. Also the "Number of wake with pending events" is a good measure. This is the count of the number of times a blocking call returned to find there was some work waiting from another thread. If the value is increasing rapidly reducing the maximum sleep value and increasing the number of non-blocking polls should help the situation.

If the "Number of DCBs with pending events" grows rapidly it is an indication that MariaDB MaxScale needs more threads to be able to keep up with the load it is under.

The _show threads_ command can be used to see the historic average for the pending events queue, it gives 15 minute, 5 minute and 1 minute averages. The load average it displays is the event count per poll cycle data. An idea load is 1, in this case MariaDB MaxScale threads and fully occupied but nothing is waiting for threads to become available for processing.

The _show eventstats_ command can be used to see statistics about how long events have been queued before processing takes place and also how long the events took to execute once they have been allocated a thread to run on.
